Description:

This Github repository contains code that implements a video chat application using the WebRTC API. The implementation includes a signaling server that needs to be turned on before establishing a connection between Alice and Bob.

To establish the connection, Alice generates an offer and sends it to the signaling server. The signaling server then sends the offer to Bob, who generates an answer and sends it back to the signaling server. The signaling server forwards the answer to Alice, allowing her to create a peer-to-peer connection with Bob.

The signaling server facilitates the exchange of SDP offer and answer and ICE candidates between the two clients. The ICE candidates are exchanged between Alice and Bob to determine the best path for media transmission.

The code in this repository is well-documented and organized, making it easy to understand and modify. The HTML page includes a textbox that logs all the steps in the connection process, allowing for easy debugging. Additionally, the HTML page includes a button that displays the recent connection state when clicked.

This repository provides a powerful and flexible solution for implementing a WebRTC-based video chat application that includes a signaling server. The application can be customized to meet specific requirements and integrated into existing web applications.

Overall, this repository provides a robust solution for implementing a WebRTC-based video chat application with a signaling server, allowing for real-time video communication between two clients.
